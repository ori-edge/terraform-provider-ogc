# ogc_traffic_source (Resource)

Represents a published target for network communications external to the OGC-deployed entities to write to. This will then be connected via a RoutePolicy to a deployed Container.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ogc_traffic_source" "ts" {
  display_name = "example"
  package_id = ogc_package.pkg.id
  address = "0.0.0.0/0"
}
```
