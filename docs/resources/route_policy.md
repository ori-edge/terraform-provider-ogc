# ogc_route_policy (Resource)

These represent layer 4 traffic routes (effectively VPN connections) to allow traffic between specified points.
If a route policy is set up from an application to a port, then an internal FQDN for the target port will be created with the format appname.orinet.ori.cloud. This will only be accessible by the source application.
If a route policy is set up from a traffic source to a port, then an external FQDN for the target application will be created with the format appname.packagename.projectname.orgname.dns.ori.cloud.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# route policy between 2 applications
resource "ogc_route_policy" "internal" {
  package_id = ogc_package.pkg.id
  application_id = ogc_application.simple_app.id
  port_id = ogc_container_port.port.id
}

# expose an application to be accessible by the outside world
resource "ogc_route_policy" "external" {
  package_id = ogc_package.pkg.id
  traffic_source_id = ogc_traffic_source.internet.id
  port_id = ogc_container_port.port.id
}

# give internet access to an application
resource "ogc_route_policy" "internet" {
  package_id = ogc_package.pkg.id
  application_id = ogc_application.simple_app.id
  remote_endpoint_id = ogc_remote_endpoint.internet.id
}
```
